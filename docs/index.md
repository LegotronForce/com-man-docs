# ComMan
Welcome to the `ComMan` documentation! Here you can find out how to develop, understand, and use `ComMan`.

## What is ComMan
`ComMan` is a virtual "shell" made in JavaScript that can be used for many things. It'll have a simple account system, programming language support, and more. It also has a simple command creation system that allows you to create your own custom commands in JavaScript.

## How to use ComMan
There isn't a public release yet, however once I feel that it is ready to be shown to the public, I'll share it. You can ask me for developmental versions, however.
